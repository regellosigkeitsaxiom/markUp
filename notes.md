# What to fix here
1. `[ﾃ余` Make syntax GitHub-flavored instead of vanilla *(still sucks)*.
1. `[ ]` Make renderer window jump to position of changed text (probably via inserting anchor).
1. `[ﾃ余` CSS!
1. `[ ]` Nice CSS.
1. `[ ]` Embed CSS fonts.
1. `[ﾃ余` Random fails "**File not found**" :( ~~Even when file is read strictly.~~
1. `[ﾃ余` Create file if it does not exist.
1. `[ ]` Add latex.
1. `[ ]` Make editor window primary.
1. `[ ]` New file should be created by $EDITOR, not wrapper.
1. `[ ]` CSS should lay in separate `.css` file, included during compilation.
