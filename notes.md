# What to fix here

1. `[ ]` Fix system fonts already.
1. `[ ]` New file should be created by $EDITOR, not wrapper.
1. `[ ]` Make renderer window jump to position of changed text (probably via inserting anchor).
1. `[ ]` Add latex.
1. `[ ]` Embed CSS fonts (probably JS).
1. `[ ]` Make editor window primary.
1. `[ ]` Try to lower memory and CPU consumption.
1. `[×]` Make syntax GitHub-flavored instead of vanilla *(still sucks)*.
1. `[×]` CSS!
1. `[×]` Nice CSS.
1. `[×]` Random fails "**File not found**" :( ~~Even when file is read strictly.~~
1. `[×]` Create file if it does not exist.
1. `[×]` CSS should lay in separate `.css` file, included during compilation.
1. `[ ]` Should make nix installer, since gc cleanes up shared libraries.
