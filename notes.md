# What to fix here
1. `[×]` Make syntax GitHub-flavored instead of vanilla _(still sucks)_.
1. `[ ]` Make renderer window jump to position of changed text (probably via inserting anchor).
1. `[ ]` CSS!
1. `[×]` Random fails "File not found" :( ~~Even when file is readed strictly.~~
1. `[×]` Create file if it does not exist.
1. `[ ]` Add latex.
